# Welcome to Binomial-Genomics

### This is a repository of code and tutorials teaching the concepts of statistical techniques related to the Binomial Distribution

Please read the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:
1) Binomial
2) Beta-Binomial
3) Mathematics - In this section there is a link to a Google Collab Notebook that will permit experimentation
4) Preliminary_Exploration
5) Dirichlet_Parameter__Prevalence_Analysis


This repository is based on the following paper:

**The Dirichlet (Alpha)-Multinomial Distribution as a model in Genomics and the utility of Artificial Intelligence in exploring gene interaction and epigenetics of depression, anxiety and Chronic Pain – development of a preliminary model**
